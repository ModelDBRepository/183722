This is the readme for the matlab model associated with the paper:

Yu N, Canavier CC (2015) A Mathematical Model of a Midbrain Dopamine
Neuron Identifies Two Slow Variables Likely Responsible for Bursts
Evoked by SK Channel Antagonists and Terminated by Depolarization
Block. J Math Neurosci 5:5

These files were supplied by Dr CC Canavier.

Usage:

Expand and start the matlab script by typing at the matlab command
prompt:

soma_bursting_driver

After a short time you should see an image similar to Fig 4A in the
